Deployment
==========

Our supported and suggested way to deploy Pinry is using Docker. We provide
support and instructions for that over at the
[docker-pinry GitHub repository](https://github.com/pinry/docker-pinry).

If you'd like a different setup then check out the hundreds of tutorials
for production Django deployment found via Google.
